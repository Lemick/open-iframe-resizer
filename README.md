# Open Iframe Resizer 

## Overview

A modern, lightweight library for resizing iframes dynamically. It is shipped under the MIT license, making it usable in commercial projects.

If you found this plugin helpful, please consider starring the repository! 

## Getting Started

### Browser (ES6 modules)

```html
<script type="module">
  import { initialize } from "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@open-iframe-resizer/core@latest/dist/index.js";

  initialize({}, "#my-iframe");
</script>
```

You can found a working example [here](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/open-iframe-resize-browser-m655zt)

### Package
Note you can also install the package through npm:
```bash
npm install @open-iframe-resizer/core
```

## Notes

### Retro-compatibility
I decided to replicate the API from the well-known iframe-resizer library, as it may facilitate migration to this project (you only need to change the script).

### Resize cross-origin iframes
To resize iframes from a different origin, you also need to load the script on your child page to enable messaging between the two windows (you do not need to call the initialize function in the child; loading the module is sufficient).
